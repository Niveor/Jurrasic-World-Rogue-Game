A Rogue game with a character based UI, built using only java and very complex OOP with multiple classes and very structured documentations and class diagrams.
there are worlds where a player can move between and dinosaurs that have specific game physics and rules that they live by including each of their unique diets, 
life span, starvation periods, how long they can go on without drinking and many more rules that interact with their environments including bushes and trees
